# How to play

There can be two or more players to play. The example you're going to see is being played with 2 players. First each player will be dealt 4 cards. Next, a player will go first. They will put down one of their cards. This will start the first stack. There is a limit of 2 stacks in the game(this varies depending on how many players you have). After the player puts down a 7 for example, the stack's value is now 7. This also makes the stack an odd stack. This means that this stack can only hold odd numbers. After any player plays a card, they must draw again. The second player will be able to start another stack or continue the first stack. If they continue the first stack, they must make sure that the card they put down in odd. Say they put down a 3. This makes the stack's value 10 now. Instead, if the second player started a stack that started with the number 2, the second stack's value would become 2 and the stack would be an even stack. After the player does one of these options it would be the first player's turn. The goal of the game is to be the player to lay the card that matchs all stacks. Here are the following cards that are played in this game:
1 - An odd number that can be played
2 - An even number that can be played
3 - An odd number that can be played
4th Card - This card can be put down in any stack to make a player automatically win the game (See 4th Card section below)
5 - An odd number that can be played
6 - An even number that can be played
7th card - A card that changes even to odd and odd to even in a stack
8 - An even number that can be played but also reverses the order
9 - An odd number that can be played but cannot be paired with a minus card
Minus card - When this card is played with another card, it changes the value from a positive to a negative
# 4th Card
The 4th card can be used to automatically make a player win the game although matching the 4th card can reverse it. For example, a player puts down a 4th card. If the second player does not have a 4th card, the first player wins. If the second player does have a 4th card and puts it down, the first player must put down another 4th card to prevent the second player from winning. This goes on until one player cannot put down a 4th card and loses.
# Number of Stacks
When only 2 players are playing, there is a limit of 2 stacks
When 3 or more players are playing, there is a limit of 3 stacks
